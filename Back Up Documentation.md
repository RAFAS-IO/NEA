# NEA (Non Exam Assessment) - Designing a ISO image in low level languages to asses the state of computers

My

## Background

The problem: There is currently no super fast super efficient minimal OS system that low level programmers or system administrators can use to test if old computer can boot quickly. This can be especially problematic for organisation such as helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking because when they need to test if the computer is experience problems with the bios or with the main os system it is good to have a temporary live environment to boot quickly from just to ensure that the computer that helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking is fixing is not experiencing problems with the bios or initial booting. helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking is also a relatively small company with only 4 employs The_Boss, Employ_1, Employ_2 and Steveo. Steveo is the only low level programmer to work at this company because of this he is in change of ensuring that the computers that helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking are fixing are not experiencing problems with there bios because that is an issues that is very difficult to fix. the reason poor Steveo can not use a pre-existing OS like ubuntu to load on is because it is slow AF on old machines this was not a problem when the company first started out and got at most 1 PC a day but now helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking is getting many computers due to a recent power serge in the area now Steveo has to deal with lots and lots of computers that all may have had there BIOS chip fried it is now his job to find a way to quickly test all of these computers and test them quickly.
