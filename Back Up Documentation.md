# NEA (Non Exam Assessment) - Designing a ISO image in low level languages to asses the state of computers


## Background 

The problem: There is currently no super fast super efficient minimal OS system that low level programmers or system administrators can use to test if old computer can boot quickly. This can be especially problematic for organisation such as helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking because when they need to test if the computer is experience problems with the bios or with the main os system it is good to have a temporary live environment to boot quickly from just to ensure that the computer that helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking is fixing is not experiencing problems with the bios or initial booting. helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking is also a relatively small company with only 4 employs The_Boss, Employ_1, Employ_2 and Steveo. Steveo is the only low level programmer to work at this company because of this he is in change of ensuring that the computers that helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking are fixing are not experiencing problems with there bios because that is an issues that is very difficult to fix. the reason poor Steveo can not use a pre-existing OS like ubuntu to load on is because it is slow AF on old machines this was not a problem when the company first started out and got at most 1 PC a day but now helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking is getting many computers due to a recent power serge in the area now Steveo has to deal with lots and lots of computers that all may have had there BIOS chip fried it is now his job to find a way to quickly test all of these computers and test them quickly.


The organisation in this project is called helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking. It is a small computer repair business that specialises in diagnosing and fixing hardware and software problems in desktop PCs and laptops. The company is based in a local community that has recently suffered from a major power surge, resulting in a sudden increase in damaged or non-booting computers.

The business has only four employees:

    The_Boss – Oversees the business and handles customer service

    Employ_1 (Daron) – General technician

    Employ_2 – General technician

    Steveo – Low-level systems programmer

Due to the recent increase in demand, the team now receives many more machines per day—some of which may have BIOS-level faults or other early boot problems.

Steveo is responsible for identifying whether each incoming computer can successfully power on, reach the BIOS, and begin the boot process. However, this is currently slow and inefficient, because there is no ultra-lightweight, high-speed, minimal operating system that can boot quickly enough to verify that a system is functioning at a basic level.

Existing operating systems such as Ubuntu or Windows PE are too slow to boot in this quick paced environment, and many of these damaged systems may not have the resources to support them. When the company only received one PC a day, this was manageable. But now, Steveo is overwhelmed.

The goal of this project is to create a custom minimal OS, designed to boot quickly and give immediate feedback as to whether a computer is functioning at a low level. This would allow Steveo (the project’s main contact) to rapidly triage incoming machines and prioritise repairs.===
