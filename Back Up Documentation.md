# NEA (Non Exam Assessment) - Designing a ISO image in low level languages to asses the state of computers

My

## Background

The problem: There is currently no super fast super efficient minimal OS system that low level programmers or system administrators can use to test if old computer can boot quickly. This can be especially problematic for organisation such as helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking because when they need to test if the computer is experience problems with the bios or with the main os system it is good to have a temporary live environment to boot quickly from just to ensure that the computer that helppleasefixmycomputeritstopedworking is fixing is not expirianceing problems with the bios or inital booting.

## Description of Current System

## Identification of User

## Data Source and Volumes

## Modelling (Data Dictionary, ERD, data flow, etc.)
